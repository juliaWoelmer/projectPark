Lot: What is the lot number
Spot: Label each spot with their own number starting from 1.
Tier: What is the permit required to park here. This is listed on the website
listed above for every parking lot. If the spot is a pay to park then the tier
is none. If the spot tier is restricted, write restricted.
Van_access: Does the parking spot sign say van accessible.
UofM_permit_req: Does the sign say this spot is enforced by additional u of m
requirements with two symbols. Almost all spots that have a tier will have this
requirement. The parking spot will usually not have additional writing if there
is no requirement.
